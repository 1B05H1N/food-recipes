Recipes for bread or whatever.

## Overview

This repository is a personal collection of **recipes**. It serves as a resource for tracking my progress, organizing my favorite recipes, and documenting my culinary journey. **I am not a professional baker—use at your own risk**.

---

## Purpose

- **Personal Reference**: A central place to store and revisit my favorite baked and non-baked recipes.  
- **Improvement**: Documenting changes and adjustments to refine recipes over time.  
- **Exploration**: Experimenting with new cooking techniques, baking methods, and ingredients.

---

## Current Status

Currently, this repository contains a **bread recipe**, but I plan to expand it with both **baked** and **non-baked** items. Over time, I’ll add recipes for pastries, cakes, cookies, and more—along with notes on techniques and tips learned through practice. Expect to see some no-bake desserts, confections, and other creations as well.
