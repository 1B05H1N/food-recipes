## Instructions

### 1. Salt the Cucumber
1. Wash the cucumber and trim both ends. For English or kirby cucumbers, cut lengthwise in half, then slice diagonally into thin pieces (about 0.5 cm / 0.2 in thick). For other cucumbers, thinly slice into rounds.
2. Place cucumber slices in a large bowl. Add salt and gently mix to coat. Let sit for **15 minutes** to draw out excess moisture.

### 2. Prepare the Vegetables & Sauce
1. While the cucumber rests, thinly slice the onion and chop the green onion (if using). Mince the garlic.
2. In a small bowl, mix together all the ingredients for your chosen seasoning (either Classic Chili-Vinegar or Soy-Sauce style) until well combined.

### 3. Rinse & Dry
1. After 15 minutes, rinse the cucumber slices under cold water to remove excess salt.
2. Drain in a strainer and gently pat dry with kitchen paper or a clean towel. Place the cucumber in a clean, dry mixing bowl.

### 4. Mix the Salad
1. Add the sliced onion, green onion (if using), garlic, and the prepared seasoning sauce to the cucumber.
2. Mix everything gently but thoroughly by hand or with a spoon until the cucumber is evenly coated and the sugar (if using) is dissolved.

### 5. Serve
1. Serve immediately as a side dish, or refrigerate for **30 minutes** to chill and let flavors meld.
2. Best enjoyed fresh, but can be stored in the fridge for up to a day.
